# tflite_model_testing
This repository contains the code used to automatically test and generate plots from trained tensorflow models in tflite format.

The images I used for testing can be found at https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/preparing_inputs.md#generating-the-oxford-iiit-pet-tfrecord-files 
The test images do not have annotations so the annotations were made and those files will be uploaded soon.
